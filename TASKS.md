# fullstack-interview

### Notes:
You are not expected to finish everything. I repeat: **You are not expected to finish everything** (I don't think I could finish everything in an hour). Do as much as you can in an hour.

Please make a new commit for each task (with a relevant commit message), and try not to commit broken code.

### Before you begin:

* rename this file to TASKS.md
* initialize an empty repository
* add TASKS.md to a .gitignore (you may also want to add node_modules, github maintains a node gitignore [here](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Node.gitignore))
* push the repository to github (and send me a link to it!)

### Finish as many of these in one hour as possible:
Note: Feel free to skip or complete tasks in any order that makes sense to you. The numbers are listed only to make reference to individual tasks.

### Tasks
